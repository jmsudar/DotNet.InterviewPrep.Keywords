    {
        // Fibonacci is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
        // The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
        // The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
        //
        // There are two ways to implement Fibonacci: recursively and iteratively.
        // Recursively is the most intuitive way to implement Fibonacci, but it is not the most efficient.
        // Recursively has O(2^n) time complexity.
        // This is exponential time complexity, which is one of the worst cases and must
        // always be avoided.
        // Iteratively is the most efficient way to implement Fibonacci.
        // Iteratively has O(n) time complexity.

        // Detailed Example based on FibonacciIterative:
        // Imagine you want to find the 6th Fibonacci number.
        // You start with a as 0 and b as 1 because those are the first two
        // Fibonacci numbers.
        // You set a temporary variable to store the sum of a and b.
        // You iterate from 2 to 6, because you already have 0 and 1.
        // At each step, you calculate the sum of a and b.
        // You set a to b, because you are moving to the next number.
        // You set b to the sum of a and b.
        // You repeat this, moving through the sequence until you reach the 6th number.
        // The 6th Fibonacci number is 8, so you return 8.

        // Detailed Example based on FibonacciRecursive:
        // Imagine you want to find the 10th Fibonacci number.
        // You start with the base case: if n is 0 or 1, return n.
        // It's important to remember that in this case, you're working backwards
        // compared to when you're doing it iteratively. This is the
        // only way that you can get base cases of 0 and 1 to work.
        // You call the function the first time with n = 10.
        // The function calls itself with n = 9 and n = 8.
        // These function calls call themselves with n = 8 and n = 7, and so on.
        // So if you look at what's getting added together,
        // you're adding 9 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0.
        // This is a lot of repeated work, which is why the recursive solution is inefficient.
        // Mathemically, this can be expressed as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for all n â‰¥ 2.
